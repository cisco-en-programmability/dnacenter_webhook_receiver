# Cisco DNA Center Webhook Receiver

This repo is for a simple Flask application that will receive webhooks notifications. 
This app is to be used only in demo or lab environments, it is not written for production. Please follow these
 recommendations for production deployments: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/deploying/.

The "flask_receiver.py" will save the notification to a file, and it will not process the notification.

Users my continue the development of this application to parse the received event notification and take the next
 steps based on their use case.

**Cisco Products & Services:**

- Cisco DNA Center

**Tools & Frameworks:**

- Python environment to run the Flask App as a Webhook Receiver

**Usage**

 - Create a new Flask App to receive Cisco DNA Center notifications
 - "flask_receiver.py" - webhook receiver 
 - "config.py" - configure your lab environment
 - "test_webhook_receiver" - app to test the webhook receiver without Cisco DNA Center
 - The notifications received will be saved to the file "all_webhooks_detailed.log"
 - Start the Flask App
 - Test by browsing to your receiver home page
 - Configure Cisco DNA Center Webhooks to send notifications to your new receiver
 - Trigger events for the configured webhooks
